# Solace Training Sample

## Repository Purpose

When learning about core concepts of Solace Event Brokers, it is helpful to generate simple messages in a "hello world" fashion to publish them, and subsequently subscribe to the same. 

This web-based tool aims to guide a user through the steps of:
1. Connecting to a Solace Event Broker
2. Registering a topic subscription to represent their interest
3. Constructing a suitable topic string and message payload
4. Sending the very first message
5. Receiving the same messages back again  

## Running the tool

The repository contents can be cloned and run locally in an offline manner. 

Alternatively it is hosted and ready to use here 👉 https://itsjamilahmed.github.io/solace-training-sample/
